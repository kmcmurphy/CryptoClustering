# CryptoClustering

This project uses an unsupervised machine learning model via SciKit-Learn in Python to predict how cryptocurrencies are impacted by 24-hour and 7-day price changes and visualizes the clusters. It uses a standard scaler to normalize the data, k-values determined via elbow curves and optimazation with PCA to compare model effectiveness.
